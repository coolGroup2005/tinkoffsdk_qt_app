## Building
- Linux (tested on rpm and deb-based distros)
  - To compile this project via CMake you need to manually replace two files in `build/_deps/grpc-src/third_party/abseil-cpp/absl/strings/internal/str_format`: [extension.cc](https://pastebin.com/uqrCrtyA) and [extension.h](https://pastebin.com/4LvmszCY)
  - Also, in `build/_deps/tinkoffinvestsdk-src/cmake/common.cmake` you might also need to change `set (CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)` to `set (CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)`
- MacOS (tested on Ventura (Apple Silicon) and Catalina (Intel))
  - See `build/deps/tinkoffinvest-src/CMakeLists.txt`, check that `cmake_minimum_required version` is `3.8`
  - See `build/deps/tinkoffinvest-src/cmake/common.cmake` and check that gRPC version is [the latest one](https://github.com/grpc/grpc.git). You might also need to change `set (CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)` to `set (CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)`
  - Modify a piece of code related to absl in `build/deps/tinkoffinvest-src/cmake/common.cmake`:

    ```

    FetchContent_Declare(
      absl
      GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp.git
      GIT_TAG        origin/master
      OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE
    )
    
    FetchContent_MakeAvailable(absl)
    message(STATUS "Using gRPC via add_subdirectory (FetchContent).")
    include(FetchContent)
    FetchContent_Declare(
      grpc
      GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/grpc/grpc.git
      GIT_TAG        v1.64.0)
    FetchContent_MakeAvailable(grpc)
